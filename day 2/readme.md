🔢 Birthday in Pi and Read documents txt — Python Project

This small Python program checks whether your birthday appears within a text file containing digits of π (pi).
It reads the digits from a .txt file, removes all whitespace, and searches for your birthday formatted as ddmmyy.

🚀 How It Works

The script opens a text file that contains digits of pi.

It removes newlines and spaces to form one continuous string of digits.

It asks the user to enter their birthday as ddmmyy.

It checks if that sequence appears anywhere in the pi digits.

It prints the result.
