# 🧮 Division Program (Beginner Python)

This simple Python program lets the user divide two numbers with error handling and an easy exit option. It is designed to practice:

- User input handling  
- While loops  
- `try / except`  
- Basic math operations

## 📌 What the Program Does

1. Asks the user for two digits (or `'q'` to quit).
2. Tries to divide the first digit by the second.
3. Detects division-by-zero errors.
4. Shows the result.
5. Lets the user continue or exit.
