# File Reading with Error Handling in Python

This project demonstrates how to read text files in Python and handle potential errors, such as missing files (`FileNotFoundError`). It shows both **visible error handling** (telling the user when a file is missing) and **silent error handling** (ignoring the error without interrupting the program).

## Files in the Example

- `gato.txt` – a sample file that may or may not exist.  
- `perroo.txt` – another sample file that may or may not exist.
