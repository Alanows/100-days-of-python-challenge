This is a simple Python program that helps you split a restaurant bill among multiple people, including a customizable tip percentage.

What I Learned:
Day 1 – Tip Calculator

Printing and Input: Practiced displaying messages to the user and collecting input from the console.
Type Conversion: Learned how to convert string inputs into int and float so calculations work correctly.
Arithmetic Operations: Used addition, division, and percentage calculations to determine the final bill.
Rounding: Used the round() function to format the result to 2 decimal places for currency.

Project Overview

The Tip Calculator helps users split a restaurant bill evenly among a group of people while including a chosen tip percentage. It calculates how much each person should pay.
How It Works
The program asks the user for the total bill, tip percentage, and number of people splitting the bill.
It calculates the tip amount based on the percentage.
It adds the tip to the bill to get the total.
Finally, it divides the total by the number of people and shows how much each person must pay.

Code Highlights
Using input() to capture user data.
Converting string input into numeric types using int() and float().
Using arithmetic expressions to calculate totals.
Formatting the final output using round() to ensure proper currency display.

It asks the user for:
💵 The total bill
💸 The tip percentage (10%, 12%, or 15%)
👥 The number of people splitting the bill
Then it calculates how much each person should pay.



🧠 How It Works

The program:
Asks for the total bill
Asks for the tip percentage
Calculates the total including the tip
Divides the amount between the selected number of people
Prints how much each person needs to pay, rounded to 2 decimals
